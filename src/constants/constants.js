Make sure to choose a username that reflects your identity as a developer.<br><br> 2. Setting Up Git:<br/> Install Git on your local machine.You can download it here.Once installed, configure Git with your username and email using the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:<br/>```bash\nCopy code\ngit config --global user.name 'Your Name'\ngit config--global user.email 'your.email@example.com'\n```<br/>Creating Your First Repository:<br/><br>3.

Cloning a Repository:<br/> To work on a project locally, you'll need to clone the repository to your machine. Use the following command, replacing < repository-url > with the URL of your GitHub repository:<br/>```bash\nCopy code\ngit clone < repository - url >\n```<br/>Working with Git<br/><br>5. Branching and Commits:<br/> Create a new branch for your work to avoid directly modifying the main codebase:<br/>```bash\nCopy code\ngit checkout - b new- feature\n```<br/>Make your changes and commit them:\n\n```bash\nCopy code\ngit add.\ngit commit - m 'Added new feature'\n```<br/><br/>6.
